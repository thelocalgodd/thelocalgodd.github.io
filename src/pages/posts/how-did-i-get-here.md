**How I Got Here: my Coding Journey**.
<br>
<br>
_This is a story of how I got into coding, as a fresher in KNUST. I talk about how I started, how I progressed, and where I am now._

<br>

**///** _First Steps (Late First Semester, 2023)_


---

<br>

My journey began unexpectedly. I had started a four-year Computer Science program at KNUST, although I was expecting to pursue Electrical Engineering. While things didn't go that way (perhaps for the best!), I found myself in Introduction to Structured Program Design during my first semester. Knowing Introduction to Programming in C++ was coming in the second semester, I decided to get a head start.
<br>
<br>
So I got onto w3schools and learned the basics of C++. It was bliss! I found it very interesting and fun and to keep my skills sharp, I started tackling a set of 49 practice questions (by Dr. Hayfron Acquah) – which were also potential exam questions.

<br>
I solved what I could and uploaded them to GitHub <sub>[1]</sub>. The remaining unsolved questions are still out there; maybe I'll revisit them in the near future.
<br>
<br>
When the actual C++ course started, I found it easy and did well in the end.

**///** _The Long Vacation (August 2023 - January 2024)_

---

<br>

Exams finished, and it was time for the long vacation – four glorious months (August to early January). With so much time and endless possibilities, I planned to work on projects with friends. Some projects thrived, some fizzled out, and some never even started, but they all provided valuable experience.
<br>
<br>
To maximize my learning during this break, I decided to explore different technologies and tools each month. My goal was to gain a solid understanding by the end of each month.
<br>
<br>
Month 1:

<hr> 
HTML, CSS, and Linux.

_I grasped these concepts well._

<br>

Month 2:

<hr>
JavaScript (a 30-day course that was great, though some parts of JavaScript were...well, challenging!)

<br>
<br>

Month 3:

<hr>
This month wasn't as successful as I'd hoped. I planned to learn React but got sidetracked by other tasks.
However, I still gained a basic understanding, which proved helpful later.

<br>
<br>

Month 4 (December):

<hr>
Project building month! I focused on creating projects, most of which are now on my GitHub profile. One of them is my first personal portfolio website.

<br>
<br>
The long vacation was a worthwhile investment. I picked up valuable skills and made online friends along the way.

**///** _Present_

<hr>
Back in school, I came across a few GitHub repositories and discovered Astro, the framework I used to build this site!
